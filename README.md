# COMP122 Assignment 2: Le chiffre indéchiffrable
Second assignment of the COMP122 course I attended at University of Liverpool.
# The Assignment
Part 1, encrypt and decrypt one letter (or other small unit) at a time.
Part 2, Monoalphabetical substitution ciphers are ciphers that decrypt and encrypt characters according to one fixed translation table.
Part 3, Caesar- where each character maps to the one k position later in the alphabet, for a fixed shift k which is the secret key.
Part 4, Vigenère cipher is to disguise the plaintext letter frequencies by not encoding each letter according to the same translation table. Instead, it uses one translation table for each letter position in the plaintext.
